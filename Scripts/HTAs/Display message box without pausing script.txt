This code displays a message box without pausing the current script.  I was scheduling / running multiple vbscripts from within an HTA tool and wanted to display a message after each script was finished without stopping / pausing anything.  This way the other scripts will continue without a user having to click on OK first.


VBScriptCopy CodeSet WshShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set objOutputFile = fso.OpenTextFile("temp.vbs", 2, -1)
objOutputFile.WriteLine "MsgBox ""Hello World"""
objOutputFile.Close
WshShell.Run "temp.vbs", 1, False
