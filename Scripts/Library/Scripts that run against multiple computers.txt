                        Wrapper Scripts: 
                        Scripts that run against multiple computers
                        by donj 
                          Sometimes you'll want to write scripts that can 
                          perform an action against multiple computers, all 
                          automatically. One easy way to do that is to create a 
                          text file containing the target computers' names, and 
                          to have the script read that file and execute whatever 
                          commands you like against each. Here's a shell script 
                          that you can use to achieve just that. Simply add in 
                          the code you want to run against each computer, and 
                          you're done!
