call one HTA from another HTA 
I tried to run one HTA from another several years ago, doesn't work.  But you can use the Windows Scripting shell:
function runApp( app ) { 
   ItemWindow = new ActiveXObject( 'WSCRIPT.Shell' ).Run( app ) ;
}

usage: runApp("YourHTA.hta") ;

I use it all the time to make custom dialog Windows.  I keep a variable in the first hta that generates the HTML and script for the second hta, saving it to a file on the fly.  You can pass parameters using windows.dialogArguments.  Get your parameters back and delete the newly made hta.

Works great.
