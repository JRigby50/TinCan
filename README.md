Creating the Robot I was promised 60 years ago, adjusted to fit my needs as of now.

When I was 9 I was promised (it seemed like a promise) a Robot that would do all of the drudge work: Vacuum the house: Cook and serve meals: Mow the lawn: Clean and dust the house: Take out the garbage: etc.  The Vacuum and Lawn Mower have been realized but the rest is still no where in sight and I am tired of waiting.

I will build what I can on my Wishlist, using readily available, Open Source parts, electronics and software.
